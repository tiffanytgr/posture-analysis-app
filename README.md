### Introduction on Posture:

Proper posture refers to the correct alignment of individual body parts in relation to adjacent segments and the entire body [1]. Maintaining good posture is crucial for overall health [2]. It ensures a balanced position of the musculoskeletal system, minimizing stress and strain on the body. Incorrect posture can lead to various musculoskeletal issues such as pain, impaired proprioception, imbalanced muscle activity, abnormal pressure on joints and ligaments, fatigue, and an increased risk of falling [3].

### Problem Statement:

In the pursuit of a healthy lifestyle, many individuals turn to running or walking as a form of exercise. However, poor running or walking posture can lead to unnecessary stress and strain on your muscles and joints, and hindered progress towards fitness goals. Poor posture can cause pain and injuries in up to 79% of adults, with low back pain affecting 25% of adults every year [4]. Poor posture may stem from various factors, such as fatigue, lack of awareness, or even ill-fitted running shoes. Understanding and correcting posture can be the key to preventing injuries and optimizing performance. Traditional methods of assessing posture often prove to be costly and inaccessible for many.

### Objective:

 This project aims to leverage computer vision technology to develop a binary classification model that identifies poor running or walking posture. The model will be trained on a dataset of images and videos of good and poor postures. Once trained, the model will be deployed via the Streamlit app, and can ingest in a image / video to identify people with poor posture in real time.
